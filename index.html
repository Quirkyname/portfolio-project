                  Through online courses, self-study, and active engagement with coding communities, 
                  I am gaining expertise in crafting visually appealing and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                   My background in hospitality equips me with a keen attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and empathy for end-users,
                    which seamlessly translates into the world of front-end development.</p>

                , I am excited to combine my management expertise with my emerging technical skills.
                 My goal is to contribute to the creation of immersive and intuitive digital experiences while making a meaningful impact on users' lives.
